# Data589 Project: Exploration of Wasps in BC
Aamna - Jason - Yuzhou - Haoxiang

Western Yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica), is an aggressive species of Wasp native to British Columbia. It can be found in open forest, prairies, urban zones, gardens, parkland, meadows, and houses. 

Our project explores:

* Where and how the species is spatially distributed in BC
* How environmental variables influence its distribution

**Our analysis can be found in the `Project.Rmd` file or in the rendered html `Project.html`.**
